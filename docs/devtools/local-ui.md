# Local UI Inspector

If you are developing for the web (React, Vue, or Angular) and don't want to spin up a separate terminal process, Bit-Form provides a lightweight, floating Local UI component.

Because Bit-Form's DevTools are completely framework-agnostic, the Inspector injects a collapsible panel directly into your DOM. It gives you a real-time window into the `BitStore` without requiring any framework-specific wrapper components.

## Usage

To enable the Local UI, simply pass `devTools: true` (or an options object) to your `BitStore` configuration.

```tsx
import { BitStore } from "bit-form";

const store = new BitStore({
  initialValues: { email: "", theme: "dark" },
  enableHistory: true, // Recommended for the Time-Travel experience

  // Enable the local DevTools automatically
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production",
});
```

That's it! Once your store initializes, a floating button will appear in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

## Features

The Local UI panel provides a compact but powerful interface:

1. **State Inspector**: A JSON tree viewer that shows real-time changes to your `values`, `errors`, and `touched` states.
2. **Validation Status**: Instantly see which fields are failing validation and view the exact error messages generated by your schema resolvers.
3. **History Controls**: If `enableHistory` is active, the panel displays controls to easily navigate back and forth through your form's state snapshots (Undo/Redo).

## Production Safety & Performance

Bit-Form's DevTools architecture uses **Dynamic Imports** under the hood.

This means that if you conditionally enable the devTools based on your environment (e.g., `devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`), bundlers like Vite, Webpack, and Rollup will automatically code-split the UI inspector logic. The DevTools code will **never** be downloaded by your users in production, keeping your final bundle incredibly fast and lightweight.
