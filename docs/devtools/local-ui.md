# Local UI Inspector

If you are developing for the web (React, Vue, or Angular) and don't want to spin up a separate terminal process, Bit-Form provides a lightweight, floating Local UI component.

This injects a collapsible panel directly into your DOM, giving you a real-time window into the `BitStore` without leaving your app tab.

## Usage (React Example)

Import the `BitDevTools` component and place it anywhere inside your `BitFormProvider` (or pass the store explicitly).

```tsx
import { BitStore } from "bit-form";
import { BitFormProvider } from "bit-form/react";
import { BitDevTools } from "bit-form/devtools/react"; // Note the /devtools import path
import MyForm from "./MyForm";

const store = new BitStore({
  initialValues: { email: "", theme: "dark" },
  enableHistory: true, // Recommended for the full DevTools experience
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BitFormProvider store={store}>
      <MyForm />

      {/* Inject the floating DevTools */}
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
        <BitDevTools position="bottom-right" />
      )}
    </BitFormProvider>
  );
}
```

## Features

The Local UI panel provides a compact but powerful interface:

1. **State Inspector**: A JSON tree viewer that automatically highlights changes in green (additions/updates) or red (deletions/errors) as you type.
2. **Validation Status**: Instantly see which fields are failing validation and view the exact error messages generated by your schema resolvers.
3. **History Controls**: If history is enabled, the panel displays a slider or step-buttons to navigate back and forth through your form's state snapshots.

## Production Safety

The DevTools components and logic are tree-shakeable. As long as you conditionally render the `BitDevTools` component based on your environment (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`), the DevTools code will not be included in your final production bundle, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
